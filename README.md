##Project Setup and Customization Instructions

This project is a creation of a simple **React Native App using Expo CLI with a blank template** where only the minimum amount of dependencies are installed.

In this project, the background colour of the `View` component is changed and the `Text` component is edited.  

###Follow these steps to create a new React Native blank template project using Expo CLI:

1. Install React Native blank using Expo CLI in your terminal:
   `npx create-expo-app YourProjectName --template blank`

2. Once the dependencies are installed, scan the **QR code** in your terminal using the Expo Go app on your phone (make sure your connected to the same wireless network) in order to display a live preview version of your app on your phone.
   
###Use the **App.js** file as the entry point to develop your app and make changes and save the file to instantly reflect changes on the live preview in Expo Go.
